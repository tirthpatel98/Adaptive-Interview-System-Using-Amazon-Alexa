# Smart-Interview-System
In any job interview there arises a hectic task for the interviewer to shortlist number of students by interviewing all the participating students .Here the smart interview system comes into the frame where the system helps in filtering students according to their technical skills by throwing number of questions at them and verifying it with the answer book. The questions thrown are adaptive and changes its difficulty level as per the candidateâ€™s answer. Also a video based confidence evaluation system will be augmented with it. Currently I am working on the project and have started performing certain deep learning and machine learning concepts in order to develop adaptive question throwing system and also started programming Amazon Alexa skills in order to implement audio based system.
